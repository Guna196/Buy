Files
index.html (or tech_landing_page.html): The main landing page displaying the tech products.

thank_you_page.html: The page displayed after a successful "purchase" (simulated by clicking the buy button).

Usage
Open index.html in your web browser.

Scroll down to see the two product listings.

Click on a "Buy Now" button to navigate to the thank_you_page.html.

On the thank you page, click "Return to Home Page" to go back to the landing page.

Customization
You can easily customize these pages:

Product Content: Edit the text, prices, and image placeholder URLs directly within index.html.

Styling: Modify the Tailwind CSS classes in index.html and thank_you_page.html to change colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.

Links: Update the href attributes for the "Buy Now" buttons and navigation links. If you implement a real checkout process, you would link to your checkout system from the landing page.

Add More Products: Copy and paste a product div block in index.html to add more products.

Add Functionality: To make the "Buy Now" buttons functional for actual purchases, you would need to integrate with a backend payment processing system (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and potentially JavaScript for handling order details.
